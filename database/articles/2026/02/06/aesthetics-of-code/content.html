<h1>Aesthetics of Code: Formatting as Art</h1>

<p>Code is read far more often than it is written. The visual structure of your source files communicates intent as much as the logic itself. Beautiful code is not vanity — it is a tool for comprehension.</p>

<h2>Symmetry and Alignment</h2>

<p>Well-aligned code creates visual patterns that the eye can follow instantly:</p>

<pre><code>// Beautiful: aligned assignments
const char *name    = "void_walker";
int         age     = 0xFF;
float       entropy = 3.14f;
bool        alive   = true;

// Ugly: random spacing
const char *name = "void_walker";
int age = 0xFF;
float entropy = 3.14f;
bool alive = true;</code></pre>

<h2>Vertical Rhythm</h2>

<p>Group related statements together and separate groups with blank lines. This creates a visual rhythm that mirrors the logical structure:</p>

<pre><code>// Parse input
char *input = read_line(stdin);
Token *tokens = tokenize(input);

// Build AST
Node *ast = parse(tokens);
validate(ast);

// Generate output
Code *code = compile(ast);
emit(code, stdout);</code></pre>

<h2>Naming as Poetry</h2>

<p>Variable names should tell a story. Compare:</p>

<pre><code>// Cryptic
int x = fn(a, b);

// Clear
int total_price = calculate_discount(base_price, membership_level);</code></pre>

<h2>The Rules</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Functions should fit on one screen.</li>
    <li>Each function should do exactly one thing.</li>
    <li>Comments explain <em>why</em>, not <em>what</em>.</li>
    <li>Consistent style matters more than any particular style.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you format code with care, you are not wasting time — you are investing in every future reader, including your future self.</p>

<h1>Vibecoding: Programming with Intent</h1>

<p>Vibecoding is not a framework, a library, or a tool. It is a philosophy — a recognition that the energy you bring to your code affects the quality of what you produce. Code written in frustration carries bugs. Code written with clarity carries elegance.</p>

<h2>The Three Principles</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Environment Matters</strong>: Your physical and mental workspace influences your output. A cluttered desk produces cluttered code. Clean your space before you open your editor.</li>
    <li><strong>Intent Before Action</strong>: Before writing a single line, understand what you are building and why. The clearest code is written by those who know exactly what they want to express.</li>
    <li><strong>Flow Over Force</strong>: Don't fight the code. If a solution feels forced, step back. Walk. Think. The right approach will reveal itself when your mind is open.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Code as Expression</h2>

<p>Every function you write is a statement of belief. Every variable name is a choice. Every architectural decision reflects your understanding of the problem. Vibecoding asks: are you expressing truth, or are you just making it compile?</p>

<h2>The Anti-Patterns</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Rage coding</strong>: Writing code while angry leads to aggressive, brittle solutions. Step away.</li>
    <li><strong>Fear coding</strong>: Adding defensive checks everywhere because you don't trust your own system. Build confidence through understanding instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Ego coding</strong>: Writing clever one-liners to impress. Clarity always wins over cleverness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Practice</h2>

<p>Before each coding session:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Take three deep breaths.</li>
    <li>State your intent clearly (out loud if needed).</li>
    <li>Begin only when you feel ready.</li>
</ol>

<p>Vibecoding is the art of aligning your inner state with your outer output. When the vibe is right, the code flows.</p>

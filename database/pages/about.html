    <h2>About VibeLog</h2>
    <p>
        VibeLog is a dark, minimalist blog built on raw C — no frameworks, no ORMs, no safety nets.
        Just pointers, file descriptors, and sheer engineering discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every page you see is served by a hand-crafted HTTP server compiled from pure C,
        reading articles from the filesystem like nature intended. No databases were harmed
        in the making of this blog.
    </p>

    <h3>The Stack</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Language:</strong> C (ISO C11)</li>
        <li><strong>Server:</strong> CWebStudio — lightweight HTTP in C</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> The filesystem itself — JSON files and directories</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Server-rendered HTML with inline CSS</li>
        <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Vibecoding — code as craft, minimalism as principle</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>
        Because sometimes the best framework is no framework. Because understanding every byte
        that leaves your server is a form of respect for the machine and the reader.
        Because we believe that constraints breed creativity, and C is the ultimate constraint.
    </p>

    <h3>Open Source</h3>
    <p>
        VibeLog is open source. The entire codebase — server, build system, and content pipeline —
        is available for inspection, forking, and judgment.

### VibeLog


Objective:
Create a blog by editing **app.c** called **mateusmoutinho** that should have a modern and minimalist yet dark and somewhat "demonic" look with dark colors.

Steps:
1. Create the main route **/** which should contain the following items:
 - A navbar with the following items:
    - Lua button that redirects to (**/list_article?page=1&category=lua&limit=10**)   
    - C button (**/list_article?page=1&category=C&limit=10**)  
    - Vibecoding button (**/list_article?page=1&category=Vibecoding&limit=10**)  
    - Software Architecture button (**/list_article?page=1&category=Software Architecture&limit=10**)  
    - A search input where the typed item redirects to (**/list_article?page=1&limit=10&search=<user input>**)  
- A body containing the 5 most recent articles fetched from the database
- A sidebar with the following items:
    - A field with the total site views, and the total views per category, sorted in descending order



2. Create the route **/list_articles?page=1&category=lua&limit=5&search=lua-for-beginners** which should return an HTML page with the same navbar as the **/** route and the body containing the article titles, creation date, article summary, and thumbnail of the articles matching the filter


3. Create the route **/article?date=13-02-2026&id=article_id** which should return an HTML page with the same navbar as the **/** route and the body containing the article title, the article content in the user's language (if a translation is available), otherwise return the text in English, and a footer containing the author and the author's profile picture.

4. Create the route **/database_file?path=file_path** which should return the requested file.

5. Create the route **/author?id=author_id** which will have the default navbar and return the author's profile picture and their full description.

6. Create the route **/about** which will return the about HTML page.
